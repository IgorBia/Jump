Leap is a chromium extension helping with organizing browser tabs and groups on more than one window.  
Currently the extension is avaible on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.

## Installation

Download the repository to a folder and load the folder to you browser's extensions.  

1. ```browser://extensions```  
2. ```Load unpacked.```  
3. ```Turn it on.```

## Usage

#### Extension pop-up  

After clicking on an extension icon pop-up opens. A user can choose a group to which the tab is to be moved.  
The tab is current active tab and it is moved to the chosen group, to basically "other" window.   
At this point the extension supports two opened windows because the tab is moved to first not-current window but over-two-windows-support is to be developed.

#### New tabs automatically in active group.

#### Collapsing groups
